# Purpose: This script dumps a list of your installed packages and packages built from the AUR and pushes those files to a git repository.
# NOTE: This script requires that you have a git repo already setup. I would recommend putting this script in /etc/cron.weekly
# Then install cronie from the official repos and enable it with systemd (systemctl enable cronie && systemctl start cronie) and that's all folks
